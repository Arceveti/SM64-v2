**TODO:**
- Known Bugs:
    - Possible to clip through the back wall of the JRB ship when jumping at it at certain angles
    - Using a shell to go up the side of SSL pillars doesn't work with FIX_RELATIVE_SLOPE_ANGLE_MOVEMENT enabled
        - Reads a null floor when hitting the pillar for some reason
    - Goddard joints don't get dragged properly on the Z axis
    - Audio is scuffed
        - Might be a HackerSM64 issue?
- Crashes:
    - Entering a level after being in another level sometimes whitescreens (rare)
    - Properly fix HMC crash
        - Current fix is increasing the gfx pool
        - Might be the same underlying issue as the above whitescreens?
    - Properly fix rumble "heavy object" crash
        - Current fix is '#define static' in rendering_graph_node.c
            - How does this fix work?

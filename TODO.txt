**TODO:**
- General Bugs:
    - The edges of Mario's silhouette are sometimes visible at low resolutions
    - Far clipping plane is too close
    - BOB door switch clicks on a timer like invisible box switches
    - Bob-Ombs get upwarped slightly when walking near certain walls
        - Noticeable on BOB door when it's opening
    - Puppycamera sometimes downwarps
        - Happens on a slope in Castle Grounds and between areas in TTM slide:
    - Instant warps freeze for a second
        - Most noticeable on TTM slide
    - Using a shell to go up the side of SSL pillars doesn't work with FIX_RELATIVE_SLOPE_ANGLE_MOVEMENT enabled
        - Reads a null floor when hitting the pillar because of the super steep floor
    - It's Possible to clip through certain moving walls like the back wall of the JRB ship when jumping at it at certain angles
        - Might be same underlying issue as the SSL pillars issue?
- Puppylights bugs:
    - Lights don't get cleared properly when leaving a level
    - Multiple light sources cause direction overflow?
    - PUPPYLIGHT_ENVIRONMENT doesn't work
- Crashes:
    - Entering a level after being in another level sometimes whitescreens (rare, hard to reproduce)
    - Properly fix HMC crash
        - Current fix is increasing the gfx pool
        - Might be the same underlying issue as the above whitescreens?
    - Properly fix rumble "heavy object" crash
        - Current fix is '#define static' in rendering_graph_node.c
            - How does this fix work?
    - Fix ending cutscene crash
- Things that happened but haven't been able to reproduce:
    - Freeze when falling onto a sideways slope in HMC
    - Mario said "haha" while swimming underwater
- Optimizations:
    - Save rom space by similar textures/models using the same file/model/displaylist

                - Replace breath meter with a small non-intrusive one that follows mario's posision on screen?

    - Combine holding variants of actions with their non-holding variants, with checks for m->used/heldObj for the differences
    - Combine/sort behavior actions, obj_behaviors, obj_behaviors_2, and object_helpers?
        - Should help VSC syntax issues

    - Gravity direction support
    - "Squished" death from any direction
- Graphics
    - Proper Skyboxes like in SM64DS
        - https://jaxry.github.io/panorama-to-cubemap/
        - Requires some sort of distortion?
        - Texture filtering on edges?
    - Fix sideways environment map textures when fixing guLookAtReflect in geo_process_master_list_sub
        - Can't just rotate the textures themselves because those are Nintendo assets
